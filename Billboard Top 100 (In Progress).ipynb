    "This dataset, available via Data.world, contains every weekly Hot 100 singles chart between 8/2/1958 and 12/28/2019 from Billboard.com. Each row of data represents a song and the corresponding position on that week's chart. Included in each row are the following elements:\n",
    "1. Billboard Chart URL\n",
    "2. WeekID\n",
    "3. Song name\n",
    "4. Performer name\n",
    "5. SongID - Concatenation of song & performer\n",
    "6. Current week on chart\n",
    "7. Instance (this is used to separate breaks on the chart for a given song. Example, an instance of 6 tells you that this is the sixth time this song has appeared on the chart)\n",
    "8. Previous week position\n",
    "9. Peak Position (as of the corresponding week)\n",
    "10. Weeks on Chart (as of the corresponding week)\n",
    "\n",
    "Also available is a dataset containing each song's \"audio features.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "These include common attributes like genre as well as the following:\n",
    "1. Danceability\n",
    "2. Energy\n",
    "3. Key\n",
    "4. Loudness\n",
    "5. Mode\n",
    "6. Speechiness\n",
    "7. Acousticness\n",
    "8. Instrumentalness\n",
    "9. Liveness\n",
    "10. Valence\n",
    "11. Tempo\n",
    "12. Time Signature\n",
    "\n",
    "Definitions of those terms are available at https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/tracks/get-audio-features/\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Liveliness: Detects the presence of an audience in the recording. Higher liveness values represent an increased probability that the track was performed live. A value above 0.8 provides strong likelihood that the track is live.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm excited about this data set. In addition to already numeric things like tempo, the ability to measure things like instrumentalness and speechiness give us some fun quantative measurements to play around with. I'm interested in looking for trends over time as well as what clusters of music might exist. It might be interesting to see if there's some seasonality to songs that spend the most time at the top, that is, is a song more likely to stay on the chart if it's released in the winter? I think there's a lot to explore here. Though admittedly, with so much to explore, I might have to be really careful with how I tidy the data. Choices I make in handling the data will make some questions easier to answer and some harder."

    "So in addition to there being two different versions of Jingle Bell Rock, it looks like 'Weeks on Chart' allows for nonconsecutive weeks and 'Instance' tracks the nth time a song has entered the chart after having fallen off. Bobby Helms jumped from 1962 to 2016 and then showed up as recently as 2018. In a separate analysis, I might be interested in how Christmas music has changed over time. I could also use the point where Christmas music enters the chart to measure \"Christmas Creep,\" the feeling that the Christmas season begins earlier each year."
