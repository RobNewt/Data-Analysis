# Data-Analysis

This is a repository of my work as I explore data and practice coding.
I currently use numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, tensorflow, and jupyter notebook, but am always looking for new tools!

1. Rolling Stone's Top 500 (EDA).ipynb

This project is an exploration of Rolling Stones top 500 albums of all time. I looked at the breakdown by genre and over time. There's a lot of Rock, and a lot of it comes from 1970-1980!
