# Data-Analysis

This is a repository of my work as I explore data and practice coding.
I currently use numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, tensorflow, and jupyter notebook, but am always looking for new tools!

1. Rolling Stone's Top 500 (EDA)

  This project is an exploration of Rolling Stones top 500 albums of all time. I looked at the breakdown by genre and over time. There's a    lot of Rock, and a lot of it comes from 1970-1980! 

2. Billboard Top 100 (EDA + Sequential Neural Network)

  Continuing with the music trend, I'm currently analyzing Billboard's Top 100 charts from 1958 to 2018. There are 2 data sets that need to be cleaned then joined. It was neat to see some of the trends, in particular song length. In the end I trained a sequential neural network to rougly predict a song's origination based on it's musicality, how many weeks it was on the chart, and it's peak position.
