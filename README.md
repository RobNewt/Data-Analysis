# Data-Analysis

This is a repository of my work as I explore data and practice coding.
I currently use numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, tensorflow, and jupyter notebook, but am always looking for new tools!

1. Rolling Stone's Top 500 (EDA)

  This project is an exploration of Rolling Stones top 500 albums of all time. I looked at the breakdown by genre and over time. There's a    lot of Rock, and a lot of it comes from 1970-1980!

2. Billboard Top 100 (In Progress)

  Continuing with the music trend, I'm currently analyzing Billboard's Top 100 charts from 1958 to 2018. Someone has also done the legwork of analyzing various aspects of "musicality" to convert things like acousticness to a measurement. It's been interesting to compare the staying power of top songs from 1958 to now. Additionally I'm currently in the process of clustering songs based on those musicality measurements to see what pockets of similar music I can find. This is still in progress.
